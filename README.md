# HateHeif
A simple [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) plugin 
that converts HEIF media into something normal ;-) and sends back
to the room.

- Works well in encrypted and unencrypted rooms. 
- Requires no configuration, plug & play!

There is also a better, improved version of this bot here: https://git.serialexperiments.club/lain/maubot-heic2jpeg
